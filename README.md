# Build
You can clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ButterWatt/ESP32-AntiDeauther.git`) and build it using VSCode and PlatformIO or using Github Actions.
# How it works
It will create an AP, after detecting deauth packages, it will shutdown the AP within 350 - 600ms (Â± 50ms), AP name and random MAC address will be applied and hosted back.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>It will **only** stop mass deauthencation flood, not targeted deauthencation, which mean targeted deauthencation would out of its protection scope. Exactly likes preventing some kids try to use fake gun, not sniper.
>
>If you blame me due to its protection not doing well to your actual access point, please, read twice.
