# How it works
It will create an AP, after detecting deauth packages, it will shutdown the AP within 350 - 600ms (Â± 50ms), AP name and random MAC address will be changed and hosted back.
>[!IMPORTANT]
>It will **only** stop mass deauth flood, not targeted deauth than its AP. It's likes preventing some kids try to use fake gun.
