# Build
You can clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ButterWatt/ESP32-AntiDeauther.git`) and build it using VSCode and PlatformIO or using Github Actions.
>[!NOTE]
>You can try `dev` branch if you want Nokia Tune, that's a legendary sound I ever heard. Unlike someone that still protecting their iPad and watch brainrot lol üòè
# How it works
It will create an AP, after detecting deauth packages, it will shutdown the AP within 350 - 600ms (¬± 60ms jitter), AP name and random MAC address will be applied and hosted back.
*Which mean some deauthers cannot track it normally by its behaviors*
>[!IMPORTANT]
>It will **only** stop mass deauthencation flood, not targeted deauthencation, which mean targeted deauthencation would out of its protection scope. Exactly likes preventing some kids try to use fake gun, not sniper.
>
>If you blame me due to its protection not doing well to your actual access point, please, read twice. Remember that's not my fault when that situation occurs.
